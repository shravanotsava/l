gurudev!
boḍo kṛpā kori’, gauḍa-vana mājhe,
godrume diyācho sthāna
ājñā dila more, ei braje bosi’,
hari-nāma koro gāna
(2)
kintu kabe prabhu, yogyatā arpibe,
e dāsere doyā kori’
citta sthira habe, sakala sohibo,
ekānte bhajibo hari
(3)
śaiśava-yauvane, jaḍa-sukha-sańge,
abhyāsa hoilo manda
nija-karma-doṣe, e deho hoilo,
bhajanera pratibandha
(4)
vārdhakye ekhona, pañca-roge hata,
kemone bhojibo bolo’
kāńdiyā kāńdiyā, tomāra caraṇe,
poḍiyāchi suvihvala

t: 1) Gurudeva! Because you are so merciful, you gave me a place in Godruma amid the woodlands of Gauda, with this order to fulfill: “Dwell here in this Vṛndāvana and sing the holy name of Hari.”
t: 2) But when, O master, out of your great mercy, will you bestow upon this servant of yours the spiritual competence to fulfill that order? When will my mind become tranquil and fixed? When will I endure all hardships and serve Lord Hari without distractions?
t: 3) Due to attachment to worldly pleasures in childhood and youth, I have developed bad habits. Because of these sinful acts my body has become an impediment to the service of the Supreme Lord.
t: 4) Now, in old age, afflicted by the five-fold illnesses, how will I serve the Lord? O master, please tell me. I have fallen at your feet weeping, overwhelmed by anxiety.
