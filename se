Refrain: I am ever engaged in repeating the sweet name of Rādhā.
t: 1) Rādhā is there in the blinking of my eyes. Rādhā is there in the curls of my hair. I have filled up the very part of my hair. Oh! With the sweet name of Rādhā.
t: 2) Rādhā is there within my vision. Rādhā is there within my speech. I interweave my every word. Oh! With the sweet name of Rādhā.
t: 3) Rādhā is there in my necklace. Rādhā is there in my sari. I have adorned my nose ring. Oh! With the sweet name of Rādhā.
t: 4) Rādhā is there in my walking. Rādhā is there in my gestures. My sash of waist-bells resounds. Oh!
With the sweet name of Rādhā.
t: 5) Rādhā is there on my right and on my left. Rādhā is there in front of me and behind. My every fiber reflects the rasa flowing. Oh! With the sweet name of Rādhā.
t: 6) Rādhā is there on my each and every limb. Rādhā is there accompanying me always. Lord Gopala plays His flute which calls out. Oh! With the sweet name of Rādhā.
