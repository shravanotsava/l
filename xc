‘gaurāṅga’ bolite habe pulaka-śarīra
‘hari hari’ bolite nayane ba’ be near

āra kabe nitāi-cānder koruṇā hoibe
saṁsāra-bāsanā mora kabe tuccha ha’be

viṣaya chāriyā kabe śuddha ha ‘be mana
kabe hāma herabo śrī-bṛndābana

rūpa-raghunātha-pade hoibe ākuti
kabe hāma bujhabo se jugala-pīriti

rūpa-raghunātha-pade rahu mora āśa
prārthanā koroye sadā narottama-dāsa

t: 1) When will that opportune moment come to us when there will be shivering of the body as soon as we chant Lord Gauranga's name? While chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, when will there be tears in the eyes?
t: 2) When will I obtain the mercy of Lord Nityanandacandra? When, by His mercy will the desire for material enjoyment become very insignificant?
t: 3) When the mind is completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires, then I shall be able to understand Vṛndāvana and the conjugal love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and then my spiritual life will be successful.
t: 4) When shall I be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvami's, headed by Śrīla Rupa Gosvami and Śrīla Raghunatha dasa Gosvami? By their instruction I shall be able to properly understand the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.
t: 5) My only aspiration is to attain the lotus feet of the Six Gosvamis headed by Śrīla Rupa Gosvami and Śrīla Raghunatha dasa Gosvami. Narottama dasa constantly prays to attain their lotus feet.
