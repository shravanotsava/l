t:
t: 1) O youthful son of the King of Vraja, You are Lord of all lords. According to Your will, creation and destruction take place in the universe.
t: 2) According to Your will Lord Brahma creates, and according to Your will Lord Visnu maintains.
t: 3) According to Your will Lord Siva destroys, and according to Your will Maya constructs the prison house of this world.
t: 4) According to Your will the living beings take birth and die, and according to Your will they meet with prosperity and ruin, happiness and
sorrow.
t: 5) The tiny soul bound up by Maya vainly struggles in the fetters of worldly desire. Without Your sanction he is unable to do anything.
t: 6) You are my only protector and maintainer. Except for Your lotus feet there is no other hope for me.
