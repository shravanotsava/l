‘doyāl nitāi caitanya’ bole’ nāc re āmār man nāc re āmār man, nāc re āmāra man
(2)
(emon, doyāl to nāi he, mār kheye prema dey)
(ore) aparādha dūre jābe, pābe prema-dhan
(o nāme aparādha-vicāra to nāi he)
(takhon) kṛṣṇa-nāme ruci ha’be, ghucibe bandhan
(3)
(kṛṣṇa-nāme anurāg to ha’be he)
(takhon) anāyāse saphal ha’be jīvera jīvan
(kṛṣṇa-rati vinā jīvan to miche he)
(ese) bṛndābane rādhā-śyāmer pa’be daraśan
(gaura-kṛpā ha’le he)
t:
t: 1) Chanting the holy name “Doyal Nitai Caitanya!”
– O my mind, please dance! O my mind, please dance! O my mind, please dance!
t: 2) Oh! Such a merciful personality as Nityananda Prabhu is not to be found anywhere! He suffers a beating from Jagai and Madhai and still gives them the love of God! Oh! When your offenses are being vanquished, you will obtain the treasure of love of God! But in these names of Caitanya and Nitai there is no consideration of offenses! Once you have a taste for the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, bondage to this world will come to an end.
t: 3) Oh! When there is attachment to the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, the life of a living being very easily becomes successful! Oh! Without affection for Kṛṣṇa, life is simply useless! At the end of life, you will obtain the beautiful vision of Rādhā and Syama in Vṛndāvana – but only when the mercy of Lord Gaura is first received! Oh!
