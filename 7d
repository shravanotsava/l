madana-mohana tanu gauranga sundara
lalate tilaka sobho urdhwe manohara
(2)
tri-kaccha basana sobhe kutila-kuntala
prakrta nayana du-i parama cancala
(3)
sukla-yajna-sutra sobhe bediya sarire
suksma-rupe ananta ye hena kalebara
(4)
adhare tambula hase adhara capiya
yaga brndabana dasa se-rupa nichiya
t:
t: 1) Graceful Lord Gauranga is more enchanting than Kamadeva. Glistening Vaiṣṇava tilaka adorns His forheead.
t: 2) He wears glorious trikaccha garments. His hair is curly. His two eyes are naturally restless.
t: 3) Manifesting a very slender form, Lord Ananta has become His white sacred-thread.
t: 4) On His lips rest betel nuts and a smile. Vṛndāvana dasa worships Him.
