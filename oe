t: 1) O Hari! O my merciful Lord! All glories to You, O Lord of Rādhā! Again and again I have pleaded with You, and now I beg You yet again to accept me as Your own.
t: 2) O Lord! Hopelessly taking birth over and over, I have now come to You for refuge. Please show Your merciful nature and deliver this wretched soul.
t: 3) You are the cause of the universe, and its very life. Other than You, O lover of Rādhā, there is no shelter.
t: 4) You bring about auspiciousness for the world, and You are the master of all the worlds as well. O Lord, what will become of me if You forsake me?
t: 5) I have understood, after contemplating my predicament, that within this world there is no one who can deliver this servant but You.
