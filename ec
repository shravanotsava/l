(1)
prabhu tava pada-yuge mora nivedan
nāhi māgi deha-sukha, vidyā, dhana, jan
(2)
nāhi māgi swarga, āra mokṣa nāhi māgi
nā kori prārthanā kono vibhūtira lāgi’
(3)
nija-karma-guna-doṣe je je janma pāi
janme janme jeno tava nāma-guna gāi
(4)
ei mātra āśā mama tomār caraṇe
ahoitukī bhakti hṛde jāge anukṣane
(5)
viṣaye je prīti ebe āchaye āmār
sei-mata prīti hauk caraṇe tomār
(6)
vipade sampade tāhā thākuk sama-bhāve
dine dine vṛddhi hauk nāmera prabhāve
(7)
paśu-pakṣi ho’ye thāki swarge vā niroye
tava bhakti rahu bhaktivinoda-hṛdoye
t:
t: 1) My Lord: I submit the following prayer at Your holy feet: I do not pray to You for physical leisure, for learning, wealth, or followers.
t: 2) I do not pray for heaven or salvation. I do not pray for any of these opulences.
t: 3) In whatever birth I take, wherever my karma leads me, let me sing the glories of Your Holy Name birth after birth.
t: 4) This alone is my cherished hope, my aspiration, my prayer at your lotus feet: Let causeless and uninterrupted devotion awaken within my heart and flow towards You.
t: 5) Let me love Your lotus feet as much as I now love sense gratification; transfer my affection from the objects of the senses to Your lotus feet.
t: 6) In danger or success, good fortune or disaster, let me remain in equipoise. And let my affection for You increase day by day by the influence of the Holy Name.
t: 7) Whether I live as bird or beast, in heaven or in hell, let the humble Bhaktivinoda always cherish bhakti in his heart of hearts.
