t: 1) O venerable Vaiṣṇava. O ocean of mercy, be merciful unto your servant. Give me the shade of your lotus feet and purify me. I hold on to your lotus feet.
t: 2) Teach me to control my six passions; rectify my six faults, bestow upon me the six qualities, and offer unto me the six kinds of holy association.
t: 3) I do not find the strength to carry on alone the sankirtana of the holy name of Hari. Please bless me by giving me just one drop of faith with which to obtain the great treasure of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa.
t: 4) Kṛṣṇa is yours. You have the power to give Him to me. I am simply your servant running behind you shouting, " Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!"
