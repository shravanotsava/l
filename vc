Gauranga Karuna Koro
Author: Narottama Das Thakura
(1)
gaurāṅga karuṇā koro, dīna hīna jane
mo-samo patita prabhu, nāhi tri-bhuvane
(2)
dante tṛṇa dhori’ gaura, ḍāki he tomār
kṛpā kori’ eso āmār, hṛdoya mandire
(3)
jadi doyā nā koribe, patita dekhiyā
patita pāvana nāma, kisera lāgiyā
(4)
poḍeci bhava tuphāne, nāhika nistār
śrī caraṇa taraṇī dāne, dāse koro pār
(5)
śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu, dāser anudās
prārthanā koraye sadā, narottam dās
t:
t: 1) O my dear Lord Gauranga! Please show Your mercy to this lowly and destitute soul. O Lord! There is no one more fallen than myself in all the three worlds.
t: 2) Holding grass between my teeth, O Lord Gaura, I am calling out to You now! Please be compassionate upon me and come to reside within the temple of my heart.
t: 3) If You do not give Your mercy, seeing how fallen I am, then why are You known as Patita Pavana -- the merciful Savior of the fallen?
t: 4) I am plunged amidst the violent hurricane- stricken waves in the ocean of this material world, from which there is no escape. Kindly give me the gift of Your divine lotus feet, which are compared to a boat in which Your servant may cross over the ocean of birth and death.
t: 5) Narottama Dasa, the servant of the servant of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Prabhu, ceaselessly makes this prayer.
