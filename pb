t:
t: 1) O Gopinātha, please remove the torment of worldly existence. I can no longer tolerate the pain of ignorance and the repeated succession of births and deaths.
t: 2) O Gopinātha, indeed I am a servant of lust. Worldly desires are awakening in my heart, and thus the noose of fruitive work is beginning to tighten.
t: 3) O Gopinātha, when will I wake up and abandon afar this enemy of lust, end when will You manifest Yourself in my heart?
t: 4) O Gopinātha, I am Your devotee, but having abandoned You and thus having forgotten my real treasure, I have worshiped this mundane world.
t: 5) O Gopinātha, You know everything. Now, having punished Your servant, please give him a place at Your lotus feet.
t: 6) O Gopinātha, is this Your judgment, that seeing me averse to You, You abandon Your servant and don't bestow even a particle of mercy upon him?
t: 7) O Gopinātha, I am certainly very foolish, and I have never known what is good for me. Therefore such is my condition.
t: 8) O Gopinātha, You are indeed the wisest person. Please look for a way to bring about auspiciousness for this fool, and please do not consider this servant as an outsider.
