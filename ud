sakhe kalaya gauram udāram
(2)
nindita hāṭaka kānti kalevara
garvita māraka māram
madhukara rañjita mālatī maṇḍita
jita-ghana kuñcita keśam
(3)
tilaka vinindita śaśadhara rupaka
bhuvana manohara veśam
madhu madhurasmita lobhita tanubhṛta
anupama bhāva vilāsam

nikhila nija jana mohita mānasa
vikathita gada gada bhāṣam
paramā kiñcana kiṇcana naragaṇa
karuṇā vitaraṇa śīlam

t: 1) My friend! That most magnanimous Śrī Gauranga Mahaprabhu has appeared as the rising sun to dispel the darkness of this age Kali.
t: 2) His brilliant golden complexion shames the bright luster of gold, and His beauty defeats the pride of Cupid. His curly black hair is decorated with a garland made of malati flowers, and bumble bees fly around them.
t: 3) His beautiful moonlike face is decorated with tilaka, and His dressing enchants the whole world. His sweet smile delivers all embodied souls from the mire of material existence, by generating in them greed for love of Godhead. He displays unique ecstatic symptoms.
t: 4) He enchants the minds of His dear ones, and He speaks with a faltering voice. In order to bestow the greatest wealth upon the poverty stricken souls of this world, He has accepted the life of renunciate, and thus distributed His mercy to all.
