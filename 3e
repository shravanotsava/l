Sundara Bala Saci Dulala
(1)
sundara-bālā śacī-dulālā
nācata śrī-hari-kīrtana meń
bhāle candana tilaka manohara
alakā śobhe kapolana meń
(2)
śire cūḍā daraśi bāle
vana-phula-mālā hiyāpara dole
pahirana pīta-piṭāmbara śobhe
nūpura ruṇu-jhunu caraṇon meń
(3)
rādhā-kṛṣṇa eka tanu hai
nidhuvana-mājhe baṁśī bājāy
viśvarūpa ki prabhujī sahi
āota prakaṭahi nadīyā meń
(4)
koi gāyata hai rādhā-kṛṣṇa nām
koi gāyata hai hari-guṇa gān
mańgala-tāna mṛdańga rasāla
bājata hai koi rańgaṇa meń

t: 1) This gorgeous boy is the darling child of mother Saci, dancing in the kirtana of chanting Lord Hari’s names. His forehead is adorned with drawings of sandalwood paste, and His enchanting locks of hair are shining splendrously as they bounce upon His cheeks.
t: 2) His hair is wrapped in a topknot, and a garland of forest flowers sways upon His chest. Wearing brilliant yellow silken garments, He dances with ankle bells tinkling upon His feet.
t: 3) Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa have become joined in one body, and together They play a flute within the grove of Nidhuvana. In this mood, the Lord of
Visvarupa has come and manifested Himself in the town of Nadiya.
t: 4) Someone in that kirtana sings the names of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, someone else sings songs of Lord Hari’s transcendental qualities, while others play the auspicious rhythms of the sweet and relishable mrdanga drums. All this takes place in that spectacular performance.
