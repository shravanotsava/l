(1)
kabe śrī caitanya more karibena dayā
kabe āmi paiba vaiṣṇava-pada-chāyā
(2)
kabe āmi chāḍiba e viṣayābhimāna
kabe viṣṇu-jane āmi kariba sammāna
(3)
gala-vastra kṛtāñjali vaiṣṇava-nikaṭe
dante tṛṇa kari’ dāḍāiba niṣkapaṭe
(4)
kāndiyā kāndiyā jānāiba duḥkha-grāma
saṁsāra-anala haite māgiba viśrāma
(5)
śuniyā āmāra duḥkha vaiṣṇava ṭhākura
āmā’ lāgi’ kṛṣṇe āvedibena pracura
(6)
vaiṣṇavera āvedane kṛṣṇa dayāmaya
e hena pāmara prati ha’bena sa-daya
(7)
vinodera nivedana vaiṣṇava-caraṇe
kṛpā kari’ sańge laha ei akiñcane
t:
t: 1) When will Śrī Caitanya Mahaprabhu show His causeless mercy to me by allowing me to attain the shade of the lotus feet of all the Vaiṣṇavas?
t: 2) When will I be able to give up this false ego which is so deeply engrossed in sense gratification? And when will I be able to properly honor the associates of the Lord?
t: 3) I will stand before the Vaiṣṇavas with folded hands, a cloth binding my neck, and a straw in between my teeth, sincerely awaiting their order.
t: 4) Weeping and weeping, I will understand the real nature of this abode of misery, and I will beg for relief from the blazing fire of this material world.
t: 5) Hearing about all of my miserable sufferings, the Vaiṣṇava Thakura will submit an appeal unto the Lord Kṛṣṇa on my behalf.
t: 6) By the prayer of the Vaiṣṇavas the all-merciful Lord Kṛṣṇa will then become compassionate towards such a sinner as me.
t: 7) Bhaktivinoda's prayer unto the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas is that: "Please be merciful and take this worthless person into your association".
