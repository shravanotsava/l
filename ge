Amar Nitai Mile Na
(1)
āmāra nitāi mile nā bholā mana
gaura mile na
sarā gāy mākhila tilaka
gaura mile nā
(2)
bhitar bahera thika na hale
gaura prema ki kothāya mile
(o tare)ṭik nā hale upāsanā
til deyinā tor de sona
sarā gāy………..
(3)
man pariskar koro age
gaura bhajana anurāge
anurāge tilak kete
gaura bhajana hala nā(hāy bholā man)
(4)
je jon mukta goṣṭi ādar kare
āmāra doyāl nitāi tahār ghare
(o tor)tare bhakti bhāre dakalā pare
utara sadā safal habe
t:
t: 1) O Lost Mind You cannot find my Lord Nityananda as well as Lord Gauranga. You have smeared your whole body with tilak but still cannot find Gaura chaand.
t: 2) How can you find the true love of Lord Gaura anywhere, if you are not properly situated internally and externally. If your worship is not proper O my friend, then you will not find that gold treasure of pure love.
t: 3) You have to first clean the dirty mind, only then will affection for the names and glorification of
Lord will arise. With affection i applied tilak......but could not do gaur bhajan..oh Lost mind !!
t: 4) My merciful Nitai stays in the home of that person who loves this eternal commodity of love. When you call out with utmost devotion to that dear one of Lord, your path will be a success and not a failure
