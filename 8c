t: 1) My dear Lord Caitanya, please be merciful to me, because who can be more merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds?
t: 2) Your incarnation is just to reclaim the conditioned, fallen souls, but I assure You that You will not find a greater fallen soul than me. Therefore, my claim is first.
t: 3) My dear Lord Nityananda, You are always joyful in spiritual bliss. Since You always appear very happy, I have come to You because I am most unhappy. If You kindly put Your glance over me, then I may also become happy.
t: 4) My dear Advaita Prabhu, husband of Sita, You are so kind. Please be merciful to me. If You are kind to me, naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityananda will also be kind to me.
t: 5) O Svarupa Damodara, personal secretary of Lord Caitanya, O six Gosvamis O Śrī Rupa Gosvami, Śrī Sanatana Gosvami, Śrī Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Śrī Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, Śrī Jiva Gosvami, and Śrī Raghunatha dasa Gosvami! O Lokanatha Gosvami, my beloved spiritual master! Narottama dasa also prays for your mercy.
t: 6) O Śrīnivasa Acarya, successor to the six Gosvamis! Please be merciful to me. Narottama dasa always desires the company of Rāmacandra Cakravarti.
