Ar Koto Kal

(refrain)
ār koto kāl, giridhārī lāl
ārāle ārāle robe
(1)
nayaneri jāl jhori abirol
daraśana pābo kabe
(2)
tomār caraṇa prabhu niyechi saraṇa
pujār kusūm sama ei tanu mana
akul āmār ei maram meri āśā
tabe ki biphale jābe
(3)
dekha jadi nāhi dibe aganir doyā
tabe keno dile āśā bhoriyā hṛdoy
mirār parāṇe tomāri kāmanā
daraśana pābo kabe

After how long will I see You, O darling Giridhari Lal? Until then, I will simply remain here, waiting and waiting!
t: 1) Tears are flowing incessantly from my eyes. O
when will I attain Your vision? Until then waiting ..
t: 2) O Lord, I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet. In Your worship, I offer my body and mind as flowers. My heart is fervent with these aspirations. Will they go unfulfilled? Until then waiting ..
t: 3) If You will not give me a glimpse of Yourself out of limitless mercy, then why have You given me this desire that completely fills my heart? O life and soul of Mira! My desire is only for You! O
when will I ever attain Your vision? Until then waiting ..
