ār keno māyā-jāle poḍitecho, jīva-mīn nāhi jāno baddha ho’ye ro’be tumi ciro-din
(2)
ati tuccha bhoga-āśe, bandī ho’ye māyā-pāśe rohile vikṛta-bhāve danḍya jathā parādhīn
(3)
ekhona bhakati-bale, kṛṣṇa-prema-sindhu-jale krīḍā kori’ anāyāse thāko tumi kṛṣṇādhīna

t: 1) O fish like soul, why have you fallen into the entangling nets of Maya? You have not understood that being bound up by those nets you will have to remain in this material world for a long, long time.
t: 2) After becoming captive in Maya’s snare due to your desires for insignificant enjoyments, you remain transformed in a spiritually diseased condition, punishable just like a disobedient servant.
t: 3) Now, by the power of devotional service, always remain subservient to Lord Kṛṣṇa, swimming and frolicking freely in the nectarine ocean of Kṛṣṇa-prema.
