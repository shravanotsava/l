emona durmati, saṁsāra bhitore,
poḍiyā āchinu āmi
tava nija-jana, kono mahājane,
pāṭhāiyā dile tumi

ohe dīna-jana, śuno bhālo kathā,
ullasita ha’be hiyā

tomāra caraṇa-tale
bhakativinoda, kāṅdiyā kāṅdiyā,
āpana-kāhinī bole

t: 1) A wicked mind brought me into this world, O Lord, but one of Your pure and elevated devotees has come to bring me out.
t: 2) He saw me so fallen and wretched, took pity, and came to me saying, “O humbled soul, please listen to this good tiding, for it will gladden your heart.
t: 3) Śrī Krishna Caitanya has appeared in the land of Navadvipa to deliver you. He has safely conducted many miserable souls such as you across the sea of worldly existence.
t: 4) “To fulfill the promise of the Vedas, the son of a brahmana bearing the name Mahaprabhu of golden complexion, has descended with His brother the avadhuta Nityananda. Together They have overwhelmed all of Nadia with divine ecstasy.
t: 5) “Śrī Caitanya, who is Krishna Himself, the son of Nanda, has saved the world by freely distributing His own holy name. Go also and receive your deliverance.”
t: 6) O Lord, hearing those words, Bhaktivinoda has come weeping to the soles of Your lotus feet and tells the story of his life.
