t: 1) All glories, all glories to the meeting of the transcendental pair, Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa! The gopis, headed by Lalita, perform the ārati ceremony for Their pleasure.
t: 2) The three-fold bending form of Kṛṣṇa, the attractor of Cupid, dressed in yellow silk dhoti and wearing a crown decorated with peacock feathers, is simply captivating to the mind.
t: 3) Sitting to the left of the charming Lord Madhava is the daughter of King Vrsabhanu, dressed in a lovely deep blue sari. Her complexion is the color of molten gold, and all characteristics of Her beauty and qualities are highly praiseworthy.
t: 4) She is decorated with various shimmering, sparkling ornaments. Her face is so splendorous that it enchants the mind of Lord Hari.
t: 5) The gopis of Visakha’s group sing many enchanting songs in various tunes, while the topmost class of gopis, known as the priya-narma- sakhis, soothe Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa by waving camara fans.
t: 6) Hoping to attain the lotus feet of Radhika and Madhava, Bhaktivinoda happily swims in the ocean of bliss found at the feet of the damsels of Vraja Dham.
