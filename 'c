(1)
ṭhākura vaiṣṇava gaṇa, kori ei nivedana,
mo boṛo adhama durācāra
dāruṇa saṁsāra nidhi, tāhe ḍubāilo vidhi,
keśe dhari more koro pāra
(2)
vidhi boṛo balavān, nā śune dharama jñāna,
sadāi karama pāśe bāndhe
na dekhi tāraṇa leśa, joto dekhi sab kleśa,
anātha kātare tei kānde
(3)
kāma krodha lobha moha, mada abhimāna saha,
āpana āpana sthāne ṭāne
aichana āmāra mana, phire jeno andha jana,
supatha vipatha nāhi jāne
(4)
nā loinu sat mata, asate majilo cita,
tuyā pade nā korinu āśa
narottama dāsa koy, dekhi śuni lāge bhoy,
tarāiyā loho nija pāśa
t:
t: 1) O saintly Vaiṣṇavas, although I am very fallen and misbehaved, I still place this appeal before you: My destiny has plunged me in the fearsome ocean of repeated birth and death. Please grab me by the hair and pull me to the opposite shore.
t: 2) My destiny is very powerful. I am not able to hear the knowledge of spiritual life, and I am always bound by the ropes of karma. I cannot see any way to escape my condition. I see only suffering. Helpless and stricken with grief, I cry.
t: 3) My blind mind cannot see what path is auspicious or inauspicious. My blind mind is helplessly dragged from here to there by lust, anger, greed, bewilderment, madness and pride.
t: 4) My mind became immersed in the impermanent satisfaction of the senses, and I could not understand the real goal of life. For this reason I did not aspire to attain Your lotus feet. Narottama dasa says: Now that I am able to see, hear, and touch the Vaiṣṇavas, I have become free from all fear.
