gāy gorā madhur sware
hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare
hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare
(2)
gṛhe thāko, vane thāko, sadā ‘hari’ bole’ ḍāko,
sukhe duḥkhe bhulo nā’ko, vadane hari-nām koro re
(3)
māyā-jāle baddha ho ‘ye, ācho miche kāja lo ‘ye,
ekhona cetana pe’ye, ‘rādhā-mādhav’ nām bolo re
(4)
jīvana hoilo śeṣa, nā bhajile hṛṣīkeśa
bhaktivinodopadeśa, ekbār nām-rase māto re
t:
t: 1) Lord Gaurasundara sings in a very sweet voice, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare, Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.
t: 2) Whether you are a householder or a sannyasi, constantly chant "Hari! Hari!" Do not forget this chanting, whether you are in a happy condition or a distressful one. Just fill your lips with the hari- nama.
t: 3) You are bound up in the network of Maya and are forced to toil fruitlessly. Now you have obtained full consciousness in the human form of life, so chant the names of Rādhā-Madhava.
t: 4) Your life may end at any moment, and you have not served the Lord of the senses, Hrsikesa. Take this advice of Bhaktivinoda Thakura: "Just once, relish the nectar of the holy name!"
