bhāi-re!
eka-dina śāntipure, prabhu adwaitera ghare,
dui prabhu bhojane bosilo
śāk kori' āswādana, prabhu bole bhakta-gaṇa,
ei śāk kṛṣṇa āswādilo
(2)
heno śāk-āswādane, kṛṣṇa-prema aise mane, sei preme koro āswādana
jaḍa-buddhi parihari', prasād bhojana kori',
`hari hari' bolo sarva jan

t: 1) O brothers! One day at Śrī Advaita's house in santipura, the two Lords-Caitanya and Nityananda-were seated for lunch. Lord Caitanya tasted the green leafy vegetable preparation and addressed the assembly of His devotees, "This sak is so delicious! Lord Kṛṣṇa has definitely tasted it.
t: 2) "At the taste of sak like this, love of Kṛṣṇa arises in the heart. In such love you should taste these remnants. Giving up all materialistic conceptions and taking the Lord's prasad, all of you just chant `Hari! Hari!'"
