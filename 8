(āmi) jamunā-puline, kadamba-kānane,
ki herinu sakhī! āja

līlā kore’ rasa-rāja

aṣṭa-sakhī parijana

(tāra) sugīta nartane, saba sakhī-gaṇe,
tuṣiche jugala-dhane
(takhan) kṛṣṇa-līlā heri’, prakṛti-sundarī,
bistāriche śobhā vane

(āmi) ghare nā jāibo, vane praveśibo,
o līlā-raser tare
(āmi) tyaji’ kula-lāja, bhaja braja-rāja,
vinoda minati kore’

t: 1) Oh sakhi! My dear girlfriend! What have I seen today? In a kadamba grove on the banks of the Yamuna, a beautiful blackish boy holding a long flute named vamsi is seated upon a throne of jewels, performing His pastimes as the King of all transcendental mellows!
t: 2) Situated upon the eight petals of the jeweled altar is Śrī Rādhā and Śrī Hari surrounded by Their attendants the eight chief gopis.
t: 3) By singing sweet songs and by dancing nicely, all the gopis satisfy the treasured Divine Couple. Thus I am beholding Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with His beautiful female consorts expanding throughout the splendorous forest.
t: 4) For the sake of the mellows of such pastimes, I will not go to my home, but I will instead enter into the forest. Renouncing all shyness due to fear of family members, just worship the Lord of Vraja. This is the humble submission of Bhaktivinoda.
