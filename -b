(śraddhāvān jan he, śraddhāvān jan he)

kṛṣṇera saṁsāra koro chāḍi’ anācār
jīve doyā, kṛṣṇa-nām-sarva-dharma-sār

t: 1) In the land of Nadiya, on the island of Godruma, the magnanimous Lord Nityananda has opened up the marketplace of the Holy Name, meant for the deliverance of all fallen souls.
t: 2) O people of faith! O people of faith! By the order of Lord Gauranga, O brothers, I beg these three requests of you: Chant " Kṛṣṇa!", worship Kṛṣṇa, and teach others about Kṛṣṇa.
t: 3) Being careful to remain free of offenses; just take the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is your mother, Kṛṣṇa is your father, and Kṛṣṇa is the treasure of your life.
t: 4) Giving up all sinful activities, carry on your worldly duties only in relation to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The showing of compassion to other souls by loudly chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is the essence of all forms of religion.
