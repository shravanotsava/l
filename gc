t: 1) Chant, chant "Rādhā- Kṛṣṇa!" Everyone chant! When Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda came dancing through Nadia, They gave these teachings: Chant, chant "Rādhā- Kṛṣṇa!" Everyone chant! You are caught up in a whirlpool of senseless action and are sinking lower and lower. Chant, chant "Rādhā- Kṛṣṇa!" Everyone chant!
t: 2) If you just understand that the spirit soul is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, you will never have any more sorrows. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and your eyes will fill with tears and your body will feel transcendental shivering. Chant, chant "Rādhā- Kṛṣṇa!" Everyone chant!
t: 3) Simply chant "Rādhā- Kṛṣṇa" and join with us. Those are the only alms we beg. Chant, chant "Rādhā- Kṛṣṇa!" Everyone chant! "All dangers will be gone when that Name is chanted," says Bhaktivinoda Thakura. Chant, chant "Rādhā- Kṛṣṇa!" Everyone chant!
