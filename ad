ṭhākura vaiṣṇava pada, avanīra susampada,
śuno bhāi hoiyā eka mana
āśraya loiyā bhaje, tāre kṛṣṇa nāhi tyaje,
āra saba more akāraṇa
(2)
vaiṣṇava caraṇa jala, prema bhakti dite bol,
āra keho nahe balavanta
vaiṣṇava caraṇa reṇu, mastake bhūṣaṇa vinu,
āra nāhi bhūṣaṇera anta
(3)
tīrtha jala pavitra guṇe, likhiyāche purāṇe,
se saba bhaktira pravañcana
vaiṣṇavera pādodaka, sama nahe ei saba,
yāte hoy vāñchita pūraṇa
(4)
vaiṣṇava sańgete mana, ānandita anukṣaṇa,
sadā hoy kṛṣṇa parasańga
dīna narottama kānde, hiyā dhairya nāhi bāndhe
mora daśā keno hoilo bhańga

t: 1) O brother, please hear my words with rapt attention. The lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas are the most valuable treasure of this world. These Vaiṣṇavas continually take shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa and worship Him. They never abandon their Lord. They are liberated. They are free from the cycle of birth and death.
t: 2) The water that has washed the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas bestows devotional service in pure love of God. Nothing else is as effective for attaining this divine love. I place dust from the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas upon my head. I wear no other ornament.
t: 3) The purifying power of the waters at the various holy places of pilgrimage is described in the Puranas, although this is something of a deceptive trick. Actually there is not anything as purifying as the water that has washed the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas. This water fulfills all desires.
t: 4) Moment after moment my mind finds pleasure in the association of the Vaiṣṇavas. I always seek out the company of those who are devoted to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Poor-hearted Narottama dasa breaks down and cries. How has this fallen condition come upon me?
