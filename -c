śuniyāchi sādhu mukhe bole sarva jana
śrī rūpa kṛpāya mile yugala caraṇa
(2)
hā hā prabhu sanātana gaura parivāra
sabe mili vāñchā pūrṇa koroho āmāra
(3)
śrī rūpera kṛpā yeno āmār prati hoy
se pada āśraya yāra sei mahāśaya
(4)
prabhu lokanātha kobe sańge loyā jābe
śrī rūpera pāda-padme more samarpibe
(5)
heno ki hoibe mora narma sakhīgaṇe
anugata narottame koribe śāsane

Lord Caitanya, please fulfill my desire.
t: 3) Please fulfill my desire that saintly Śrīla Rupa Gosvami may be merciful to me, and that I will be able to take shelter of his lotus feet.
t: 4) When will my master, Lokanatha Gosvami, place me at the lotus feet of Śrīla Rupa Gosvami?
t: 5) When, by your mercy, will your faithful follower
Narottama dasa become eligible to receive direct
instruction from the gopi-friends of the Divine
Couple?
