t:
t: 1) The divine couple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, is my life and soul. In life or death I have no other refuge but Them.
t: 2) In a forest of small kadamba trees on the bank of the Yamuna, I will seat the divine couple on a throne made of brilliant jewels.
t: 3) I will anoint Their dark and fair forms with sandalwood paste scented with cuya, and I will fan Them with a camara whisk. Oh, when will I behold Their moonlike faces?
t: 4) After stringing together garlands of malati flowers I will place them around Their necks, and I will offer tambula scented with camphor to Their lotus mouths.
t: 5) With the permission of all the sakhis, headed by Lalita and Visakha, I will serve the lotus feet of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.
t: 6) Narottama dasa, the servant of the servant of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Prabhu, longs for this service to the divine couple.
