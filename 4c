(1)
ki rūpe pāibo sevā mui durācāra
śrī guru vaiṣṇave rati nā hoilo āmāra
(2)
aśeṣa māyāte mana magana hoilo
vaiṣṇavete leśa mātra rati nā janmilo
(3)
viṣaye bhuliyā andha hoinu divā-niśi
gale phāńsa dite phire māyā se piśācī
(4)
ihāre koriyā jaya chāḍāno nā yāya
sādhu kṛpā vinā āra nāhiko upāya
(5)
adoṣa-daraśi prabhu! patita uddhāra
ei bāra narottame koroho nistāra

t: 1-5) "How can an ill-behaved person like me attain devotional service? I have no loving attachment to Śrī Guru and Vaiṣṇavas. My mind is endlessly absorbed in maya, and I don't even have the slightest loving attachment to the Vaiṣṇavas. I have been blinded due to being absorbed in sense gratification day and night and the witch named maya repeatedly hangs a noose around my neck. There is no way to defeat her or give her up unless I attain the mercy of the saints. O Vaiṣṇava! O master! You do not look for faults, but you simply redeem the fallen! This time redeem this Narottama!"
