Sundara Mora Mana Kisora
(refrain) sundara mor mana-kiśor
eso he śyāmala nayanābhirām
(1)
bhajibo tomāi mor mana chāi
caraṇer rākhi ekṭi praṇām
eso he śyāmala nayanābhirām
(2)
nayaner prema more loye jāi
milaner sur virohe sukhāi
prāṇer devatā kabe nāhi kathā
nayaner dhārā mane nābhirām
eso he śyāmala nayanābhirām
(3)
emni kore ār koto kāl
kāṅdale āmāi giridhārī-lāl
ei jīvane hāi jadi nāhi pāi
maraṇer upare śaraṇa nilām
eso he śyāmala nayanābhirām

Refrain: O beautiful one! O youthful boy who lives in my heart! Please come to me, O dark Syamal, O delighter of my eyes!
t: 1) The desire of my heart is to worship You intimately. In this hope, I humbly bow unto Your lotus feet.
t: 2) O love of my eyes! Please take me with You! While I am suffering in Your separation, the melody of our impending meeting is the only thing that gives me any happiness. O monarch of my life! Why do You remain silent and never speak to me? Tears are flowing from my eyes, and nothing in this world gives me any satisfaction.
t: 3) How much longer must I continue living in this condition? You are making me weep and cry out for You, O darling Giridhari Lal! If I cannot attain You in this lifetime, then I shall just give up and surrender myself unto death.
