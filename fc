(1)
hari he!
prapañce poḍiyā, agati hoiyā,
nā dekhi upāya ār
agatira gati, caraṇe śaraṇa,
tomāya korinu sār
(2)
karama geyāna, kichu nāhi mora,
sādhana bhajana nāi
tumi kṛpā-moya, āmi to’ kāńgāla,
ahaitukī kṛpā cāi
(3)
vākya-mano-vega, krodha-jihvā-vega,
udara-upastha-vega
miliyā e saba, saṁsāre bhāsā’ye,
diteche paramodvega
(4)
aneka jatane, se saba damane,
chāḍiyāchi āśā āmi
anāthera nātha! ḍāki tava nāma,
ekhona bharasā tumi
t:
t: 1) O Lord Hari, having fallen helplessly into the illusion of this world, I see no other means of deliverance but You. You are the only recourse for the helpless. I accept the shelter of Your lotus feet as essential.
t: 2) I have no knowledge, no background of pious activities, nor any history of strict devotional practice. But You are full of compassion and kindness. Therefore, although I am certainly destitute, I solicit Your causeless mercy.
t: 3) The powerful urges of speech, mind, anger, tongue, belly, and genital have banded together to cast me adrift on the sea of this material world, thus causing me great anxiety and trouble.
t: 4) After great endeavor to subdue these material demands, I have completely given up all hope. O Lord of the destitute, I call upon Your holy name, for now You are my only shelter.
