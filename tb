Gurudeve Vraja Vane Vraja Bhumi Vasi Jane
Author: Bhaktivinoda Thakura
(1)
gurudeve, vraja-vane, vraja-bhumi-vasi jane,
suddha-bhakte, ara vipra-gane
ista-mantre, hari-name, yugala bhajana kame,
kara rati apurva yatane
(2)
dhari mana carane tomara
janiyachi ebe sara, kṛṣṇa-bhakti vina ara,
nahi ghuce jivera samsara
(3)
karma, jnana, tapah, yoga, sakalai ta karma-
bhoga,
karma chadaite keha nare
sakala chadiya bhai, sraddha-devira guna gai,
yanra krpa bhakti dite pare
(4)
chadi' dambha anuksana, smara asta-tattva mana,
kara tahe niskapata rati
sei rati prarthanaya, śrī-dasa-gosvami paya,
e bhakativinoda kare nati

t: 1) (1) The Divine Master (2) Śrī Vṛndāvana (3) The residents of Śrī Vṛndāvana (4) The pure Vaiṣṇavas (5) The brahmana section (6) The worshipful mantra (7) The holy name (8) A yearning to serve the Couple Divine: I adore these eight with utmost dedication.
t: 2) O dear mind, I implore thee at thy feet. Already we have learned the essence: nothing but Lord Kṛṣṇa's service dispels the soul's illusory experience.
t: 3) Duty, knowledge, penance, meditation -all are really exploitation: none can free us from action and reaction; Cast them all aside, O my brother, sing the glory of good faith, our mother whose grace alone bestows pure devotion.
t: 4) Banish your pride forever, O my mind, your eight goals remember: adore them with a heart that is sincere. Aspiring for that devoted heart, at Śrī Dasa Goswami's feet this Bhaktivinoda makes his prayer."
