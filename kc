(1)
śrī-kṛṣṇa-kīrtane jadi mānasa tohār
parama jatane tāhi labho adhikār
(2)
tṛnādhika hīna, dīna, akiñcana chār
āpane mānobi sadā chāḍi’ ahańkār
(3)
vṛkṣa-sama kṣamā-guna korobi sādhan
prati-hiṁsā tyaji’ anye korobi pālan
(4)
jīvana-nirvāhe āne udvega nā dibe
para-upakāre nija-sukha pāsaribe
(5)
hoile-o sarva-gune gunī mahāśoy
pratiṣṭhāśā chāḍi koro amani hṛdoy
(6)
kṛṣṇa-adhiṣṭhāna sarva-jive jāni’ sadā
korobi sammāna sabe ādare sarvadā
(7)
dainya, doyā, anye māna, pratiṣṭhā-varjan
cāri gune gunī hoi’ koroha kīrtan
(8)
bhakativinoda kāńdi’, bole prabhu-pāy
heno adhikāra kabe dibe he āmāy
t:
t: 1) If your mind is always absorbed in chanting the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa with great care, then by that process of Śrī- kṛṣṇa-kirtana you will attain transcendental qualification.
t: 2) You should give up all false pride and always consider yourself to be worthless, destitute, lower and more humble than a blade of grass.
t: 3) You should practice forgiveness like that of a tree, and giving up violence toward other living beings, you should protect and maintain them.
t: 4) In the course of passing your life, you should never give anxiety to others, but rather do good to them while forgetting about your own happiness.
t: 5) When one has thus become a great soul, possessing all good qualities, one should abandon all desires for fame and honor and make one's heart humble.
t: 6) Knowing that Lord Kṛṣṇa resides within all living
creatures, one should with great respect consistently show honor to all beings.
t: 7) By possessing these four qualities-humility, mercifulness, respect toward others, and the renunciation of desires for prestige-one becomes virtuous. In such a state you may sing the glories of the Supreme Lord.
t: 8) Weeping, Bhaktivinoda submits his prayer at the lotus feet of the the Lord: "O Lord, when will you give me the qualification for possessing attributes such as these?"
