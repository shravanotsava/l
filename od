ga0000urāṅga tumi more doyā nā chāḍiho
āpana koriyā rāṅgā caraṇe rākhiho

tomār caraṇa lāgi sab teyāgilu
śītala caraṇa pāyā śaraṇa loilu

e kule o kule muñi dilu tilāñjali
rākhiho caraṇe more āpanār boli

vāsudeva ghoṣe bole caraṇe dhoriyā
kṛpā kori rākho more pada-chāyā diyā

t: 1) Oh Lord Gauranga! Please do not neglect to show me Your mercy! Making me Your very own property, kindly keep me situated at the reddish soles of Your feet.
t: 2) With the intention of attaining Your feet, I have utterly renounced everything. Now I have taken full shelter of Your soothing lotus feet.
t: 3) Whether I am related to this family lineage or that family lineage – I have completely abandoned them all. I beg You to mercifully keep me by Your feet, calling me Your own.
t: 4) Vasudeva Ghosh says, “Since I have tightly grasped hold of Your feet, please keep me here by always bestowing their soothing shade.”
