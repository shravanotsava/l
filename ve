mahimā beda-purāṇe bākhāni

t: 1) O Tulasi Maharani! O Vrnda! O mother of devotion! O Narayani, I offer my obeisances to you again and again.
t: 2) By seeing you or even by touching you, all sins are destroyed. Your glories are described in the Vedas and Puranas.
t: 3) Your leaves and soft manjaris are entwined at the lotus feet of Narayana, the Lord of Laksmi. O blessed mother Tulasi, you performed successful austerities and have thus become the chief consort and queen of Śrī salagrama-sila.
t: 4) You gladden and shower your rain of mercy upon one who offers you some incense, a ghee lamp, naivedya, and ārati. The Lord does not care for even one of fifty-six varieties of cooked food or thirty-six different curries offered without tulasi leaves.
t: 5) Lord Siva, Sukadeva Gosvami, Devarsi Narada, and all the jnanis and great munis, headed by Lord Brahma, are circumambulating you. O mother! O Maharani, Candrasekhara thus sings your glories. Please bestow upon him the gift of pure devotion.
