t: 1) I know now Your divine feet are a refuge free from all sorrow and fear, eternally full of sweet nectar.
t: 2) At the soles of those lotus feet I surrender myself and all I possess.

t: 4) At last I know myself to be Your eternal servant, whose maintenance You have assured.
t: 5) Life before, without You, held nothing but sorrow. Now I live free from all misery
t: 6) Laksmi, desiring such a place at Your lotus feet, executed austerities. Only after securing a place by Your lotus feet did Lord Siva attain his sivatva, or quality of auspiciousness.
t: 7) Upon obtaining those feet Lord Brahma became successful in life, and the great sage Narada Muni held those two feet to his heart.
t: 8) Your lotus feet drive away all fear. Having held them to my head, I dance in great ecstasy, singing their glories.
