t: 1-2) Out of compassion for the fallen souls, Śrī Krisna Caitanya came to this world with His personal associates and divine abode to teach saranagati, surrender to the almighty Godhead, and to freely distribute ecstatic love of God, which is ordinarily very difficult to obtain. This saranagati is the very life of the true devotee
t: 3-4) The ways of saranagati are humility, dedication of the self, acceptance of the Lord as one’s only maintainer, faith that Krishna will surely protect, execution of only those acts favorable to pure devotion, and renunciation of conduct adverse to pure devotion.
t: 5) The youthful son of Nanda Maharaja, Śrī Krishna, hears the prayers of anyone who takes refuge in Him by this six-fold practice.
t: 6-7) Bhaktivinoda places a straw between his teeth, prostrates himself before the two Goswamis, Śrī Rupa and Śrī Sanatana, and grasp their lotus feet with his hands. “I am certainly the lowest of men.” he tells them weeping, “but please make me the best of men by teaching me the ways of saranagati”
