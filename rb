gurudeva!
kṛpā-bindu diyā, koro’ ei dāse
tṛṇāpekhā ati hīna
sakala-sahane, bolo diyā koro
nija māne spṛhā-hīna
(2)
sakale sammān, korite śakati
deho’ nātha! jathājatha
tabe to’ gāibo, harināma-sukhe
aparādha ha ‘be hata
(3)
kabe heno kṛpā, lobhiyā e jana
kṛtārtha hoibe, nātha!
śakti-buddhi-hīn, āmi ati dīn
koro’ more ātma-sātha
(4)
jogyatā-vicāre, kichu nāhi pāi
tomāra karuṇā sāra
karuṇā nā hoile, kāṇḍiyā kāṇḍiyā
prāṇa nā rākhibo āra
t:
t: 1) Gurudeva, give to this servant just one drop of mercy. I am lower than a blade of grass. Give me all help. Give me strength. Let me be as you are, without desires or aspirations.
t: 2) I offer you all respects, for thus I may have the energy to know you correctly. Then, by chanting the holy name in great ecstasy, all my offenses will cease.
t: 3) When will such mercy fall to this one who is weak and devoid of intelligence? Allow me to be with you.
t: 4) If you examine me, you will find no qualities. Your mercy is all that I am made of. If you are not merciful unto me, I can only weep, and I will not be able to maintain my life.
