jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo, gauracānda bole
kota nidrā yāo māyā-pīśācīra kole
(2)
bhajibo boliyā ese soṁsāra-bhitore
bhuliyā rohile tumi avidyāra bhore

tomāre loite āmi hoinu avatāra
āmi vinā bandhu āra ke āche tomāra

enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi’
hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi māgi’
(5)
bhakativinoda prabhu-caraṇe poḍiyā
sei hari-nāma-mantra loilo māgiyā

t: 1) Lord Gaurānga is calling, "Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls! How long will you sleep in the lap of the witch called Māyā?
t: 2) You have forgotten the way of devotional service and are lost in the world of birth and death.
t: 3) I have descended just to save you; other than
Myself you have no friend in this world.
t: 4) I have brought the medicine that will wipe out the disease of illusion from which you are suffering. Take this mahā-mantra-Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare."
t: 5) Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Thākura says: "I fall at the
Lord's feet, having taken this mahā-mantra."
