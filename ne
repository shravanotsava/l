Duhkher Sagore
(refrain)
duḥkher sāgore bhāsiyechi
uttāriye jāni nā
(1)
uthāl deu āsiche chuṭiyā
ki habe tāhā jāni nā
(2)
dīna-doyāl tumi bhagavān
pār koro āmāi shāmne tuphān
(3)
tumi jadi prabhu nāhi koro pār
pārer āśā rākhi nā

Refrain: I am swimming in the ocean of material suffering, and I do not know of any way to be lifted out.
t: 1) O Lord! Please rescue me from the raging storm that is rapidly approaching with torrents of rain. When it reaches me, I do not know what will happen.
t: 2) You, O Lord, are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is merciful to poor fallen souls. Please save me from the terrible storm that menaces before me.
t: 3) If You do not deliver me, O Lord, then I do not even hope to be saved.
