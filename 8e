Vamsi Dhari Kṛṣṇa Murari
(1)
vaṁsidhāri kṛṣṇa murāri
tuma vina duḥkha hāre
kṛpa karo nāth me hū mānā
rākho lāj hamāre
(2)
abhaya caraṇa karata smaraṇa
japa nām tere
āp mujhe hī, swāmī bhaja
āp giridhāri
t:
t: 1) O Vamsi-Dhari! O Kṛṣṇa Murari! Without You, all is misery, O remover of my distress! Please be merciful to me, O Lord, and protect my modesty.
t: 2) Kindly cause me to remember Your feet that bestow fearlessness, and allow me to chant Your holy name. O Lord! I worship You, O Giridhari!
