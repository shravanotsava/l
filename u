namas te narasiṁhāya prahlādāhlāda-dāyine
hiraṇyakaśipor vakṣaḥ- śilā-ṭaṅka-nakhālaye
t: 1) I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasimha, who gives joy to Prahlada Maharaja and whose nails are like chisels on the stone like chest of the demon Hiranyakasipu.
(2)
ito nṛsiṁhaḥ parato nṛsiṁho yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ
bahir nṛsiṁho hṛdaye nṛsiṁho nṛsiṁham ādiṁ śaraṇaṁ prapadye
t: 2) Lord Nṛsimha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Nṛsimha is there. He is in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Nṛsimha, the origin of all things and the supreme refuge.

tava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-śṛṅgaṁ
dalita-hiraṇyakaśipu-tanu-bhṛṅgam
keśava dhṛta-narahari-rūpa jaya jagadīśa hare
(The above verse is the 4th verse from Śrī Dasavatara Stotram by Jayadeva Goswami)
t: 3) O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of half-man, half- lion. All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp between one's fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasp like demon Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your beautiful lotus hands.
