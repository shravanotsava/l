kabe gaura-vane, suradhunī-taṭe,
‘hā rādhe hā kṛṣṇa’ bole’
kāṅdiyā beḍā’bo, deho-sukha chāḍi’,
nānā latā-taru-tale
(2)
śwa-paca-gṛhete, māgiyā khāibo,
pibo saraswatī-jala
puline puline, gaḍā-gaḍi dibo,
kori’ kṛṣṇa-kolāhala
(3)
dhāma-bāsī jane, pranati koriyā,
māgibo kṛpāra leśa
vaiṣṇava-caraṇa- reṇu gāya mākhi’,
dhori’ avadhūta-veśa
(4)
gauḍa-braja-jane, bheda nā dekhibo,
hoibo baraja-bāsī
dhāmera swarūpa, sphuribe nayane,
hoibo rādhāra dāsī

t: 1) When, oh when will I wander here and there, weeping under the shade of the trees and creepers along the banks of the celestial Ganges River in Navadvipa? I will cry out "Oh Rādhe! Oh Kṛṣṇa!", and I will completely forget about all the so-called pleasures of this material body.
t: 2) When will I be able to live so simply by begging some food from the homes of the untouchables who live here and there? I will drink the water of the Sarasvati, and in ecstasy I will roll to and fro on the banks of the river, raising a loud uproar of " Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!"
t: 3) When will I bow down to all the inhabitants of the holy land of Navadvipa and receive a bit of their causeless mercy? I will smear the dust of the Vaiṣṇavas' lotus feet all over my body, and I will wear the dress of a mad wandering mendicant.
t: 4) When I factually observe that the transcendental land of Navadvipa is non different from Śrī Vraja-bhumi, then I shall be transformed into a Vrajabasi also. Then I will see the true form of the transcendental realm opening up before my very eyes, and I will thus become one of the maidservants of Śrīmati Rādhārāni.
