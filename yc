gorā pahuṅ nā bhajiyā mainu
prema-ratana-dhana helāya hārāinu
(2)
adhane jatana kori dhana teyāginu
āpana karama-doṣe āpani ḍubinu
(3)
sat-saṅga chāḍi’ kainu asate vilās
te-kāraṇe lāgilo je karma-bandha-phāṅs
(4)
viṣaya-viṣama-viṣa satata khāinu
gaura-kīrtana-rase magana nā hainu
(5)
keno vā āchaye prāṇa ki sukha pāiyā
narottam dās keno nā gelo mariyā
t:
t: 1) I did not worship Lord Gauranga Prabhu and thus I became full of suffering. I refused to accept the treasure of pure love of Kṛṣṇa, and thus I became lost.
t: 2) I reject the treasure of love of Kṛṣṇa and deliberately struggled to become poor. I dived into a host of sinful deeds.
t: 3) I rejected the association of the saintly devotees, and instead tried to enjoy among the impious non-devotees. In this way I became caught in the noose of karma.
t: 4) I continually drank the virulent poison of sense- gratification. I refused to swim in the nectar of Lord Caitanya's sankirtana movement.
t: 5) Why do I stay alive? What happiness do I
have? Why did Narottama dasa not die long ago?
