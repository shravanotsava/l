t: 3) Slay me or protect me as You wish, for You are the master of Your eternal servant.
t: 4) If it is Your will that I be born again, then may it be in the home of Your devotee.
t: 5) May I be born again even as a worm, so long as I may remain Your devotee. I have no desire to be born as a Brahma averse to You.
t: 6) I yearn for the company of that devotee who is completely devoid of all desire for worldly enjoyment or liberation.
t: 7) Father, mother, lover, son, Lord, preceptor, and husband; You are everything to me.
