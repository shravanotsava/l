Author: Bhaktivinoda Thakura
(refrain) mama mana mandire raha niśi-din kṛṣṇa murāri śrī kṛṣṇa murāri
(1)
bhakti prīti mālā candan
tumi nio he nio cita-nandan
(2)
jīvana maraṇa tava pūjā nivedan
sundara he mana-hārī
(3)
eso nanda-kumār ār nanda-kumār
habe prema-pradīpe ārati tomār
(4)
nayana jamunā jhare anibār
tomāra virahe giridhārī
(5)
bandana gāne tava bajuk jīvana
kṛṣṇa murāri śrī kṛṣṇa murāri

Refrain: Please abide in the temple of my heart both day and night, O Kṛṣṇa Murari, O Śrī Kṛṣṇa Murari!
t: 1) Devotion, love, flower garlands, and sandalwood- please accept them, O Delighter of the Heart!
t: 2) In life or in death I worship You with these offerings, Beautiful One, O Enchanter of the Heart!
t: 3) Come, son of Nanda, and then, O Son of Nanda, I will offer Your ārati ceremony with the lamplight of my love.
t: 4) The waters of the Yamuna river cascade incessantly from my eyes in your separation, O Holder of Govardhana Hill!
t: 5) May I pass my life absorbed only in songs of
Your praise, O Kṛṣṇa Murari, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Murari!
