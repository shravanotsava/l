Raja Rani Mira
Author: Mira Bai
(refrain)
rāj-rāṇī mīrā bhikhāriṇī
giridhāri tomāro lāgiyā
(1)
(āmi) pathe pathe ghūri bhikhārinī
hari nām bhikhā māgiyā go
(2)
loke bole mīrā pāgalinī
rāṇā kohe kūla kalańkinī
mīrā kohe prabhu giridhāri
(mīrā) āśā pathe royeche chāhīyā go
(3)
dekha dāo prabhujī prabhujī
mīrā kāńde tomāro lāgiyā
kāńdaiyo nā abhāgire
rākho more ańge miśaya go
(4)
giridhāri tomāro prāṇ mirār
giridhāri tomāro lāgiyā

Refrain: The queen Mira is simply a beggar- woman, but only for Your sake, O Giridhari!
t: 1) I simply wander here and there like a mendicant, but I seek only the alms of Your holy name.
t: 2) People say, “Mira has become a madwoman.” The King says, “She has disgraced her family.” But Mira says, “O Lord Giridhari, my only desire is to remain at Your lotus feet.”
t: 3) O Prabhuji! Kindly reveal Yourself to me! Mira simply weeps for You, my Lord. Please don’t make this most unfortunate person cry any more. Please keep me tightly embraced, as if united with Your own body.
t: 4) O Giridhari! You are the life and soul of Mira!
