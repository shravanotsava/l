t: 1) O dear one who belongs to Vṛndāvana! O darling son of Nanda Maharaja! O prince of the cowherd boys, kindly play again on Your flute so we may hear the melodies dear to all Your friends.
t: 2) O Gopal, since You’ve left Vṛndāvana, the flowers have lost their desire to bloom. Still we decorate the moonlit groves of Madhuvan, hoping You will return for Your amorous rendezvous.
t: 3) Śrīdāma, Sudāma, and Your brother Balarāma are calling, “O Kanai! Please come back!” While tending the calves and playing on their flutes they entreat, “O brother! Please come home!”
t: 4) Mother Yasoda is crying out, “O Gopal! You are my life and soul! Please come home, O butter thief!” Within the heart of Śrīmati Rādhārāni, divine love for You flows like the Yamuna River.
